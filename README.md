# pecee/boolean-query-parser

Convert a boolean search query into a query that is compatible with a fulltext search.

### Notes

This library is a maintained fork of the original project "BooleanSearchParser" created by DuncanOglethat, [available here](https://github.com/DuncanOgle/BooleanSearchParser).

The goal of this project is to iron out bugs, optimise the code, add new features and make it compatible with future versions of PHP.

## Requirements

- PHP 7.1 or higher

### Installation

```
composer require pecee/boolean-query-parser
```

### Parsing a query

```php
$parser = new \Pecee\BooleanQueryParser\BooleanQueryParser();

$formattedQuery = $parser->parse('ict OR (technology AND bob)');
```

**Output**

```
ict (+technology +bob)
```

### Order

Order and brackets are important, more often than not OR logic takes priority

`sales OR finance AND manager` will become `sales finance +manager` and not `sales +finance +manager`

## Examples

|Input|Output|
|-----|------|
|`ict` |   `+ict`|
|`ict it` |   `+ict +it`|
|`ict OR it` |   `ict it`|
|`NOT ict` |   `-ict`|
|`it NOT ict` |   `+it -ict`|
|`web AND (ict OR it)` |   `+web +(ict it)`|
|`ict OR (it AND web)` |   `ict (+it +web)`|
|`ict NOT (ict AND it AND web)` |   `+ict -(+ict +it +web)`|
|`php OR (NOT web NOT embedded ict OR it)` |   `php (-web -embedded ict it)`|
|`(web OR embedded) (ict OR it)` |   `+(web embedded) +(ict it)`|
|`develop AND (web OR (ict AND php))` |   `+develop +(web (+ict +php))`|
|`"ict` |   `null `|
|`"ict OR it"` |   `+"ict OR it"`|

## Advanced examples
|Input|Output|
|-----|------|
`"business development" or "it sales" and (danish or dutch or italian or denmark or holland or netherlands or italy)` | `"business development" "it sales" +(danish dutch italian denmark holland netherlands italy)`
`(procurement or buying or purchasing) and (marine or sea) and (engineering or engineer)` | `+(procurement buying purchasing) +(marine sea) +(engineering engineer)`
